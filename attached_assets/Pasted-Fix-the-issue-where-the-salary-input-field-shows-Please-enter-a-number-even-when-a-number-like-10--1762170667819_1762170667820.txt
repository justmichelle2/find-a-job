Fix the issue where the salary input field shows "Please enter a number" even when a number like 10,000 is entered.
Update the code so that:
•	The input accepts both plain numbers (e.g., 10000) and formatted numbers with commas (e.g., 10,000).
•	On submission, it converts any formatted input to a valid numeric value (e.g., 10000).
•	Use proper HTML5 validation or JavaScript parsing to handle this cleanly.
•	If the field uses <input type="number">, allow it to accept comma-formatted input or switch to <input type="text"> with validation that ensures only numeric values are accepted.
•	Make sure the salary still saves as a number in the database.
Add an admin portal and dashboard to this campus job search web app.
Make sure of the following:
1. Authentication System
•	Implement separate login and registration systems for:
o	Companies / Employers: can post, edit, and manage job listings.
o	Students / Job Seekers: can browse, search, and apply for jobs.
•	Each user type should have its own dashboard after login (e.g., /company/dashboard and /student/dashboard).
•	Ensure role-based access control so employers can’t access student features and vice versa.
•	Admins should have full control through /admin — they can view all users, job posts, and manage platform activity.
2. Admin Portal
•	Create an /admin dashboard showing:
o	Total number of users (companies & students)
o	Total number of job postings
o	Applications overview
o	A section to approve or remove job posts.
3. Company Dashboard
•	Let companies:
o	Post new jobs
o	View, edit, and delete their posted jobs
o	See applicants for each job
4. Student Dashboard
•	Let students:
o	View all available jobs
o	Apply for jobs
o	View their application history
5. Salary Field Update
•	In the job posting form:
o	Add a dropdown menu next to the salary input to select currency (e.g., GHS, USD, EUR, GBP, NGN, etc.)
o	Ensure the chosen currency is saved to the database and displayed properly in job listings.
6. UI & UX
•	Make dashboards clean, responsive, and modern (use Tailwind or Bootstrap if needed).
•	Add clear navigation between login, dashboard, and job pages.
7. Optional (if using Django or Flask backend):
•	Use Django’s built-in admin for superuser control.
•	Use model-based user roles (e.g., is_company, is_student, is_admin).
•	Ensure proper form validation and CSRF protection.
Finally, test everything to confirm:
•	Users are correctly redirected based on their roles.
•	Currency selection works in job posts.
•	Admin can see and manage all activities from their dashboard.

Fix the error OperationalError: no such column: jobs_jobpost.is_approved in this Django project.
Steps to take:
1.	Check the JobPost model inside jobs/models.py — it has an is_approved field that doesn’t exist in the database.
2.	Run the proper Django migration commands to create or update this column:
o	python manage.py makemigrations jobs
o	python manage.py migrate
3.	If the migrations don’t apply correctly, create a new migration file manually to add the is_approved field to the JobPost model with a default value of False.
4.	Ensure all migrations are applied and the database schema matches the current model definitions.
5.	Restart the server and verify that the homepage (JobListView) loads correctly without the OperationalError.
Fix the issue where posted jobs do not appear on the job listings page — it always shows “No job posted” or “No job found.”
Steps to correct this:
1.	Check the JobPost model in jobs/models.py and confirm that job posts are being saved correctly when submitted through the “Post Job” form.
2.	Inspect the JobListView (or equivalent view function) and make sure it retrieves all valid jobs from the database.
o	If it filters by is_approved=True, temporarily remove that filter or ensure newly created jobs have is_approved=True by default.
3.	Verify that the job posting form (forms.py or views.py) correctly calls .save() and commits the object to the database.
4.	Update the template (job_list.html or equivalent) to correctly loop through the job objects and display their data.
5.	Test the process: post a new job, refresh the job list, and confirm it displays.
6.	If the data is not being stored, add debugging logs or print() statements to confirm form validation and saving.
Bonus:
•	Ensure migrations are applied and the database isn’t empty due to a reset.
•	Make sure the correct queryset is being passed to the template context.
